# frontend-testing-comparative
A comparative between the most important frontend testing framework

The main purpose of this comparative is to find what testing tool best fits my needs.
I want to perform the following validations during the development process:
- Unit Testing
- Component functional testing
- CSS regression testing
- E2E testing

The selected frameworks are:
- Intern.js
- Webdriver IO
- Wraith-selenium
